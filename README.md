# Speed Dating Predictor
Welcome to the Speed Dating Predictor project! This application predicts whether two people would be a match based on several criteria: attractiveness, fun, shared interest, sincerity, and intelligence. Users can input values between 0 and 10 for each criterion, and the application will return a response indicating whether it is a match or not.
